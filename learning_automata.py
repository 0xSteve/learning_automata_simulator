'''Learning_automata.py is a module containing some learning automata.'''

# Written by: Steven Porretta.

# For now it only contains a Tsetlin 2N,2 automaton.

# Write a Tsetlin automaton.
# A Tsetlin automaton is defined by N memory states, R actions,
# and c penalties.
#
# N is expected to be a whole number indicating memory depth.
# R is expected to be a while number indicating the number of,
# actions.
# c is a vector quantity indicating the penalties for actions
# 1 to i.

    '''Tsetlin automata. N, R positive integers. c a structure
       of penalties from action 1 to action i.'''
